# React Router and HOC 

These two projects are to check topics like React Router and HOC. 

The tutorial for these projects are by **The Net Ninja** you could the all the video tutorials in shi [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) They are very interesting and also you can learn different progamming languages and frameworks, I recommend this channel.

I'm worked in two different ways on the same project result.

The concept of the project is display a list of posts and you can pick one post to check the specific info that post has.

## First Way Project
This first way I used React Router Dom, axios, redux, redux-thunk. Something that I did different on this project was how I could handle the info to check an specific post. Checking the **react-router-dom** documentation and fighting to get the expected result. I found out a way to work with the tag Link to get the info I wanted to use to be display on the specific selected post.

## Second Way Project

The second way is how the tutorial worked to get done this project. The difference with the other way is how get the info to display on the Post component, I considerate this way very important because this way is something that could be handle in different project, don't misunderstand the **First Way Project** (The first way project was a good practice to figure it out how I could get the expect result in different way).

In both cases I used HOC to showed up what you could do with it. This project is very good if you want to understand React Router. Also It is a good practice to check redux.
